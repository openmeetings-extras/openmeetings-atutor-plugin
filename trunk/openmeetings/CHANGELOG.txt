- Allow each group to have their own meeting, anyone in the group can start off the meeting, and when all exit, room should be deleted.

- Instructor should probably be capable to adjust their own meeting size in their own config.
- Research on how recorded video works, see if we can remove meetings as well.
- admin/openmeetings, check if there is a slash at the end.
